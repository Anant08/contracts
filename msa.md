## Services

### Definition of Services

Company agrees to perform services for Client as described in one or more Statements of Work, an example of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Services").

## Work Provisions

### Independent Contractor

For all purposes hereof and in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, Company is and shall remain an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement or in a Statement of Work shall be deemed or construed to create an employer/employee, joint venture, or partnership relationship between Company and Client. Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to create an employment relationship between Client and any employee, agent, or independent contractor of Company. Neither party shall have any authority to insure any obligations on behalf of the other party or to make any promise, representation or contract of any nature on behalf of the other party.

### Company's Personnel

Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Statement of Work, Company shall have sole discretion over the identity of its personnel used to provide the Services, provided that Company shall ensure that the personnel are in all cases suitably qualified and experienced. Where specific personnel are specified in an applicable Statement of Work, Company shall use reasonable efforts to provide the Services through those personnel, provided that Company shall be entitled to replace such personnel with
personnel of equivalent qualification and experience on no more than 15 (fifteen) days notice to Client. Without limiting the foregoing, Client acknowledges that it is Company's standard policy not to allocate the same personnel to any one client or project for periods exceeding 6 (six) months.

### Non-Exclusivity

Client understands that Company may, at any time, be working on projects for other clients. Client agrees that such other projects shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, even if the services Company provides to other clients are substantially similar to the Services Company is providing to Client. Company recognizes that Client may engage other consultants to perform similar services from time to time, and this Agreement shall not prevent Client from using such consultants.

## Term

This Agreement shall become effective as of the date Client and Company have signed below, and shall continue in effect until terminated by either party as provided herein.

Client shall also pay a late fee of $39 (thirty-nine dollars) with every late payment.

### Failure to Pay

Client's failure to remit timely payment shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. Client's failure to remit timely payment shall entitle Company, in addition to all other available remedies, to suspend all of its work and other obligations hereunder immediately and without notice, and Company shall not be required to resume its work or other obligations until Client has paid all amounts due, in full.

### Taxes and Fees

All fees charged for Services hereunder are exclusive of any taxes and similar fees now in force or enacted or imposed in the future on the delivery of such Services, all of which shall be Client's responsibility.
