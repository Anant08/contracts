        All right, title and interest in and to all Inventions, including but not limited to all patentable rights that may subsist therein, shall be held and owned solely by the Company, and where applicable, all Inventions shall be considered works made for hire.  In the event that any Inventions shall be deemed not to constitute works made for hire, or in the event that Employee should otherwise, by operation of law, be deemed to retain any rights to any Inventions, Employee hereby assigns to the Company, without further consideration, all right, title and interest in and to each and every such Invention.  Employee shall mark all Inventions with such proprietary notices as directed by the Company and shall take all actions deemed necessary by the Company to protect the Company's rights therein.  Employee is not restricted, during the period of his employment by the Company, from conceiving, developing or creating intellectual property that does not constitute an Invention, and the Company shall have no right, title or interest in any such intellectual property.

      All right, title and interest in and to all Works of Authorship, including but not limited to all registrable rights that may subsist therein, shall be held and owned solely by the Company, and where applicable, all Works of Authorship shall be considered works made for hire.

    1. Employee Assistance; Authorization.  Employee shall assist the Company in every lawful way to obtain, maintain, and from time to time enforce, patents, copyrights or other analogous rights or protections relating to any Inventions or Works of Authorship.  In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Employee's signature on any patent, copyright or other analogous protections relating to Inventions or Works of Authorship, whether because of Employee's physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee's agents and attorneys-in-fact, to act for and on Employee's behalf to execute and file any such applications or other documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance, maintenance, and enforcement of letters patent, copyright or other analogous rights or protections relating to Inventions and Works of Authorship in any and all countries with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Employee.  Employee's obligation to assist the Company in obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing patents, copyrights or other analogous rights or protections relating to Inventions and Works of Authorship shall continue beyond the period of his employment by the Company, but the Company agrees to compensate Employee at a reasonable rate after such period for time actually spent by Employee at the Company's request on such assistance.
